                     Release 0.1 for Linux and Mac OSX
============================================================================

The Krokodile Cartridge is a programmable game cartridge for the 2600 game
console.  The cartridge contains 512K of Flash ROM that can be programmed by
connecting the cartridge to a Windows PC with a serial cable.  Once connected
to a PC, the Windows-based Krokodile Commander software is then used to
download software into the Krokodile Cartridge.  The cartridge also includes
32K of built-in RAM to support games that require additional onboard
cartridge memory (such as Atari's SARA-chip games).

KrokCom is a cross-platform application used to program the Krokodile
Cartridge from a serial port/USB-serial converter for Linux/UNIX and OSX
systems.  Both GUI and commandline usage is supported.

This is the 0.1 release of KrokCom for Linux and Mac OSX.  The distributions
currently available are:

  * Binary distribution in 32-bit Ubuntu DEB format (krokcom_0.1-1_i386.deb)

  * Binary distribution in 64-bit Ubuntu DEB format (krokcom_0.1-1_amd64.deb)

  * Binary distribution for Mac OSX (KrokCom0.1.dmg)
