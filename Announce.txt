                   Release 1.3 for Linux/UNIX and macOS
===========================================================================

The Krokodile Cartridge is a programmable game cartridge for the 2600 game
console.  The cartridge contains 512K of Flash ROM that can be programmed
by connecting the cartridge to a PC with a serial cable.  Once connected
to a PC, the Krokodile Commander software is then used to download software
into the Krokodile Cartridge.  The cartridge also includes 32K of built-in
RAM to support games that require additional onboard cartridge memory
(such as Atari's SARA-chip games).

KrokCom is a cross-platform application used to program the Krokodile
Cartridge from a serial port/USB-serial converter for Linux/UNIX and macOS
systems.  Both GUI and commandline usage is supported.

This is the 1.3 release of KrokCom for Linux and macOS.  The
distributions currently available are:

  * Binary distribution in 64-bit Ubuntu DEB format:
